### Works Released in 2024

In the United States, works typically enter the public domain 95 years after their publication date if they were published between 1923 and 1977. For works published after 1977, they generally enter the public domain 70 years after the death of the author. For works published before 1923, they are already in the public domain.

As of 2024, the works entering the public domain in the United States include:

1. Works published in 1928.
2. Works by authors who died in 1953 (if the work was unpublished or published after 1977).

This means that books, films, music, and other creative works first published or released in 1928 are now free to use without copyright restrictions.

Here are some notable works from 1928 that have entered the public domain:

- "The House at Pooh Corner" by A.A. Milne
- "Decline and Fall" by Evelyn Waugh
- "The Well of Loneliness" by Radclyffe Hall
- Films like "The Cameraman" starring Buster Keaton and "Steamboat Bill, Jr." starring Buster Keaton

Keep in mind that the copyright status can vary by country, and this information is specific to U.S. copyright law. If you need information on specific works or different jurisdictions, feel free to ask!
